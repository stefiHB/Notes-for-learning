The following example is from the article 
["5 Common Mistakes with RxJS"](https://blog.bitsrc.io/5-common-mistakes-with-rxjs-1b09d4c19387) by Giancarlo Buomprisco.

### Things to remember
> "One of the greatest things about RxJs is that combining operators and reusing their
> logic is an incredibly nice (and easy) way to build reusable bits of code. ... . RxJS streams are pipeable,
> which means they can be combined and extended and therefore reused." 
~Giancarlo Buomprisco.

> "...keep the logic within the subscription callbacks as small as possible"* 
~Giancarlo Buomprisco.
